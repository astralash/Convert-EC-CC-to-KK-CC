# FromECtoKK

	Automatically convert EC chara cards in current folder and its subfolders to KK cards.
	
	Output will be placed in a new folder with original folder structure.
	The new folder is named "ConvertedFromECtoKK" + TimeStamp.
	
	It's safe to use because the result will not cover original files.
	
	It will not convert pngs that is not a CC or already KK.
	
	The KKEx part is through simply copying, so it's not sure all information is transplanted correctly.
	
# Update
	2022-12-26 V1.1
	Add KKEx copy(simply copy without transformation)
